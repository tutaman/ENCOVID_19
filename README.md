Amid the COVID-19 outbreak, the ENCOVID-19 provides information on the well-being of Mexican households in four main domains: labor, income, mental health, and food insecurity. It offers timely information to understand the social consequences of the pandemic and the lockdown measures. It is a project consisting of a series of cross-sectional telephone surveys collected once a month for one year. In addition to the four main domains and a set of COVID19-related questions, the survey includes new key indicators every month to capture the impact of the pandemic on issues like education, social programs, and crime. This is the first dataset of the project, corresponding to April 2020, collected one month after the lockdown began in Mexico.
